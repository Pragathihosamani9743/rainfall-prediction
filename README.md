# Rainfall Prediction Project

This project predicts annual and daily rainfall using Random Forest regression on historical rainfall data from Gundlupet.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses rainfall CSV data.
- Handles missing values and creates date-based features.
- Predicts annual rainfall from monsoon rainfall.
- Predicts daily rainfall for any given date.
- Evaluates model performance with RMSE and RÂ².
- Visualizes actual vs predicted rainfall and daily rainfall trends.

## How to Use
1. Place your CSV data file (`Gundlupet.csv`) in the project folder.
2. Run the Python script.
3. Input a date (YYYY-MM-DD) to get daily rainfall prediction.
4. Input a year to get predicted daily rainfall plot for that year.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
